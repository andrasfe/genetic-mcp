# Genetic Algorithm MCP Server - System Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the genetic algorithm-based idea generation MCP server architecture, synthesizing insights from domain experts across genetic algorithms, parallel processing, MCP protocols, and fitness evaluation.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Asynchronous Architecture**
Based on parallel processing expert recommendations, we've chosen an async/await pattern using Python's asyncio for handling I/O-bound LLM API calls. This provides optimal concurrency without the overhead of OS threads.

### 2. **Semantic-Aware Genetic Operations**
Following genetic algorithm expert guidance, we implement chunk-based crossover at semantic boundaries and semantic mutations using synonym replacement, preserving idea coherence while enabling meaningful evolution.

### 3. **Multi-Objective Fitness with Adaptive Weights**
The fitness evaluation combines relevance (cosine similarity), novelty (distance from neighbors), and feasibility (critic rating) with adaptive weight adjustment to prevent gaming and encourage diverse solutions.

### 4. **Layered MCP Architecture**
The protocol implementation separates transport (stdio/HTTP/SSE) from business logic, enabling clean support for multiple transports while maintaining a consistent message format.

### 5. **Redis-Based State Management**
Session state is persisted in Redis for resilience and potential horizontal scaling, with configurable TTLs and automatic cleanup of expired sessions.

## Critical Implementation Insights

### From Genetic Algorithm Experts:
- **Population Size**: 30-100 individuals balances diversity with computational efficiency
- **Diversity Preservation**: Use fitness sharing and niching to prevent premature convergence
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Start with high mutation rates, gradually shift to exploitation
- **Encoding Strategy**: Combine textual tokens with semantic vectors for meaningful operations

### From Parallel Processing Experts:
- **Rate Limiting**: Centralized token bucket algorithm prevents API quota exhaustion
- **Circuit Breakers**: Protect against cascading failures with automatic recovery
- **Backpressure**: Implement flow control to prevent overwhelming downstream systems
- **Memory Optimization**: Share common contexts and use streaming processing

### From MCP Protocol Experts:
- **Versioning**: Include version fields in all messages for backward compatibility
- **Session States**: Use explicit state machines for clear lifecycle management
- **Error Handling**: Structured error reporting with categories and recovery paths
- **Extensibility**: Design for forward compatibility with optional fields

### From Fitness Evaluation Experts:
- **Normalization**: Use robust scaling (IQR-based) to handle outliers
- **Anti-Gaming**: Ensemble critics and diversity bonuses prevent exploitation
- **Semantic Similarity**: Pre-trained transformer embeddings for accurate relevance
- **Adaptive Functions**: Meta-learning to improve fitness evaluation over time

## Architecture Highlights

### Component Responsibilities:

1. **MCP Server Core**: Protocol handling, message routing, transport abstraction
2. **Session Manager**: State persistence, lifecycle management, timeout handling
3. **Worker Pool Manager**: LLM orchestration, rate limiting, failure recovery
4. **Genetic Engine**: Population evolution, operator application, convergence detection
5. **Fitness Evaluator**: Multi-objective scoring, normalization, adaptation
6. **Idea Codec**: Semantic encoding/decoding, similarity computation
7. **Lineage Tracker**: Evolution history, parent-child relationships, analysis

### Performance Optimizations:

- **Embedding Cache**: LRU cache reduces redundant computations
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar LLM requests for efficiency
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections to LLM APIs
- **Async Everything**: Non-blocking I/O throughout the stack

### Scalability Considerations:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Session affinity with Redis-based state
- **Worker Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic adjustment based on load
- **Resource Limits**: Per-session quotas and memory bounds
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback strategies for overload
